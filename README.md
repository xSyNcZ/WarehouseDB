So basically this might look a bit like a mess (it kinda is), but it works (or at least worked, because for an unknown reason when imported into a Datamodeler or SQLDeveloper it didn't import properly)
However, all the data is indeed there, screenshots of the entity and relational diagrams are also there. The code used to create the tables, inserts, etc. is also there.
